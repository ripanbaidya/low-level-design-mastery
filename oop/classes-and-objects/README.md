## Classes and Objects

## Introduction

Classes and objects form the foundational building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They provide the mechanism to translate real-world entities into modular, maintainable, and structured source code. For software engineers, understanding the deep relationship between class structures, object instantiation, and memory mechanics is critical for building performant applications.

## 1. What is a Class?

A **class** is a programmer-defined blueprint, template, or data type from which individual objects are created. It establishes a contract defining what data an object will maintain and what behaviors it can perform.

A class defines two primary components:

- **Attributes (Fields / State):** The structural variables that store the data or current state of the object.
- **Methods (Behaviors):** The functional blocks of code that operate on the state and define what the object can do.

### Defining a Class in Java

```java
// Class definition acting as the blueprint
class Car {
    // Attributes (State) - Encapsulated via private access modifiers
    private String name;
    private String color;

    // Constructor - Initializes the object instance state in memory
    public Car(String name, String color) {
        this.name = name;
        this.color = color;
    }

    // Method (Behavior) - Exposes functionality to external callers
    public void start() {
        System.out.println(name + " has started.");
    }
}

```

### UML Representation

Unified Modeling Language (UML) provides a standard notation to visualize a class structure:

```
+--------------------------+
| Car                      |
+--------------------------+
| - name: String           |
| - color: String          |
+--------------------------+
| + Car(name, color)       |
| + start(): void          |
+--------------------------+

```

- `-` denotes `private` access visibility.
- `+` denotes `public` access visibility.

## 2. What is an Object?

An **object** is a self-contained, concrete instance of a class that exists at runtime. While a class is a compile-time structural blueprint that consumes no memory space, an object is the live instantiation that allocates memory and holds real values.

### Instantiating Objects in Java

The `new` keyword is used to bring an object to life at runtime:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // car1 and car2 are separate reference variables pointing to distinct objects
        Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Red");
        Car car2 = new Car("Honda", "Blue");

        // Executing behaviors on the instances
        car1.start();
        car2.start();
    }
}

```

### Runtime Execution Mechanics

Executing the statement `Car car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Red");` triggers a strict three-step sequence within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM):

1. **Allocation (Instantiation):** The `new` keyword instructs the JVM to allocate a block of memory dynamically inside the **Heap** region to house the object's instance data.
2. **Initialization:** The target constructor (`Car(...)`) is invoked immediately to assign the provided baseline arguments (`"Toyota"`, `"Red"`) to the newly allocated instance variables.
3. **Reference Assignment:** The memory address pointing directly to the heap object is bound to the stack reference variable (`car1`).

## 3. JVM Memory Architecture

To write deterministic, bug-free applications, an SDE must visualize exactly how the JVM manages memory allocation across the **Stack** and the **Heap** frames.

### The Stack Segment

- Houses the execution thread contexts, local variables, and method call frames.
- Stores the **reference variable** (`car1`). The reference variable does _not_ contain the object data; it holds the specific hex memory pointer (address) pointing to the actual data location.

### The Heap Segment

- Houses all dynamically created runtime objects.
- Holds the actual value states (`name = "Toyota"`, `color = "Red"`). Objects persist on the heap until they have no active references pointing to them, making them eligible for Garbage Collection (GC).

### Deconstructing the Instantiation Syntax

```java
Car c1 = new Car("Toyota", "Red");

```

| Syntax Component       | Architectural Role         | JVM Execution Domain                                  |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Car`                  | **Data Type**              | Evaluated during compilation                          |
| `c1`                   | **Reference Variable**     | Allocated inside the local **Stack** frame            |
| `new`                  | **Allocation Operator**    | Instantiates raw memory layout inside the **Heap**    |
| `Car("Toyota", "Red")` | **Constructor Invocation** | Injects initial state attributes into the heap object |

## Key Principles

- **Reference vs. Value Semantics:** Passing an object reference as a method argument passes a copy of the _address pointer_ (Call-by-value of the reference). Modifying the internal state properties of that object inside the method alters the unified shared heap instance, impacting all components holding that reference.

- **Preventing Memory Leaks:** Unintentional retention of reference pointers in long-lived collections prevents the Garbage Collector from freeing dead heap space, eventually degrading performance. Always explicitly clear references or bounds when an object lifecycle terminates.
